# A simple Login System in Java

This project is a simple login system developed in Java. It was created to demonstrate basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), using encapsulation with getters and setters.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **OOP** (Object Oriented Programming)

## Features

- Creation of accounts with username and password.
- Login with credential validation.
- Data encapsulation through getters and setters.

## Project Structure

The system is divided into classes that represent the main objects:

1. **Class `Users`**: Represents the user with the attributes `name` e `password`, Includes getters and setters methods for each attribute, keeping the data encapsulated.
2. **Class `Login_system`**: Manages the authentication process. Allows the selection of a user and validates the password with three attempts before blocking access.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the classes `Users` and `LoginSystem`.
3. Run the class `LoginSystem` to start the login system.

## Important Note

All login passwords for this project are set to "12345" for simplicity.
